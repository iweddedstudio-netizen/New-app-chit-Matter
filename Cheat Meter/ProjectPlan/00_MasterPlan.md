# CheatMeter iOS - Master Project Plan

This document serves as the central hub for the CheatMeter development plan. The project is divided into phases to ensure a structured and efficient workflow.

## Project Overview
**CheatMeter** is an iOS weight loss companion app designed to gamify the journey to a healthier body. Unlike strict calorie counters, CheatMeter focuses on positive reinforcement.

**Core Concept:**
1.  **Set a Goal:** Users define their start and goal weight.
2.  **Earn Rewards:** As users lose weight and hit "Checkpoints" (e.g., every 1kg lost), they earn "Cheat Meals" or "Cheat Days".
3.  **Stay Motivated:** The app tracks "Slips" (unplanned cheat meals) and "Streaks" (days on track), helping users visualize their consistency.
4.  **Privacy First:** All data is stored locally on the device using SwiftData. No accounts, no servers.

**Target Audience:** People looking for a flexible, motivation-based approach to weight loss who want to be rewarded for their discipline.
